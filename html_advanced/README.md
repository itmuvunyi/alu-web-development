# HTML Advanced Project

Welcome to the **HTML Advanced** project of the ALU Web Development track!

## Project Objective

This project marks the beginning of building a webpage **from a Figma design**, focusing exclusively on **HTML semantic structure**. You will recreate the layout and elements of the provided design **without using CSS or JavaScript**.

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand how to interpret a web design from Figma.
- Apply semantic HTML5 elements appropriately.
- Structure web content effectively and accessibly.
- Prepare a clean foundation for adding styles later.

## Project Details

- **Fonts used**:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - Spin-Cycle-OT *(may require external download if not available by default)*
- **What to do if fonts are missing**: Visit the links above to download or install them.

### Technologies

- HTML5 (Semantic tags)
