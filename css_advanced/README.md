# Advanced CSS Project

## Project Overview

This project is the continuation of the **HTML, Advanced** project and focuses on transforming our semantic HTML structure into a fully styled and responsive webpage using CSS.

Using a designer file provided in Figma, we will:
- Apply modern CSS styling techniques
- Ensure responsiveness across screen sizes
- Use Flexbox and Grid for layout structuring
- Maintain a clean and organized CSS structure

## Goals

- Style the HTML structure created in the previous project.
- Ensure a pixel-perfect layout that closely matches the Figma design.
- Optimize for readability, usability, and responsiveness.

## Files

- `index.html`: The base HTML file (copied from `html_advanced`)
- CSS files to be added: `styles.css`, `base.css`, etc.

## Figma Design

Make sure to **Duplicate the design to your Figma Drafts** to inspect:
- Layout spacing
- Font styles
- Colors and buttons
